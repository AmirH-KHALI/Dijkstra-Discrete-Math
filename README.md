# Discrete Mathematics Final Project: Dijkstra

This is a simple program that implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph.

## Technologies

This project uses Java and JavaFX.

## Launch

To run this project, you need to have Java and JavaFX installed on your system. You can download Java from https://www.java.com/en/download/ and JavaFX from https://openjfx.io/.

You also need to have IntelliJ IDEA as your IDE. You can download it from https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/.

To launch the program, open the project folder in IntelliJ IDEA and run:

`Main.java`

## Usage

The program will display a window with a graph of nodes and edges. You can click on any two nodes to select them as the start and end points. The program will then highlight the shortest path between them using Dijkstra's algorithm. You can also drag any node to change its position and see how the path changes accordingly.

## Status

This project is completed.
